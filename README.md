# Jamboree-Education---Linear-Regression

## Project Overview

Jamboree, renowned for facilitating students' admission to top international colleges, has launched a novel feature on their website. This feature estimates the probability of admission to IVY league colleges from an Indian perspective. Your role is pivotal in analyzing the dataset provided (jamboree_admission.csv) to unravel the key factors influencing graduate admissions. Utilizing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and linear regression techniques, you'll uncover insights into the interplay of various admission criteria and predict chances of admission based on these variables.
